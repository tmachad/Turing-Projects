# Turing-Projects
Old projects of mine written in Turing. Most of them are games, and they're all functional enough to play. If you wish to play around with the code, you can download the Turing IDE [here](http://compsci.ca/holtsoft/). If you just want to try out the programs, you can download and run the .exe files.

### Block Tower
This is simple game about stacking blocks to make a tower, but it's one of my more polished pieces, alongside Zombie Survival 2. Based on numerous arcade and web games featuring a similar theme, Block Tower challenges you to drop blocks on top of eachother to form an ever growing tower, gaining points based on the level and your accuracy in dropping the block. As you progress, the blocks move faster as you try to place them, and also get smaller to increase the difficulty. This is one of my games that features the universal high score system that I have reused in Zombie Survival 2 and several other games.

### Circle Travel
A little tool I made to learn about calculating circular motion in a linear fashion, such as moving something `x` distance along the edge of a circle rather than rotating `y` degrees around the circle. I made this is after coming home from a coding challenge in high school, and in response to a particular question in the challenge that required this kind of knowledge.
The resulting tool lets you control the movement of a dot around a circle, either by moving it with the up and down arrow keys, or setting it to auto mode and letting it move on its own.

### Gravitation
This one is a hybrid game/simulation, inspired by my love of space and my new found understanding of gravity, courtesy of my high school physics class. It's a small, not to scale model of our solar system including the Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth and the Moon. The interesting part about it is that rather than the various objects simply rotating around one another, every movement is calculated using Newton's law of universal gravitation (with a massively scaled up gravitational constant).
To make it more interactive and interesting, you also have the opportunity to hurl meteoroids at the various planetary bodies by clicking and dragging the mouse in the direction you want to aim. The physics get a little strange when things actually start colliding, but have fun wreaking havoc or being benevolent as you see fit!

### Zombie Survival 2
The second installment in my small personal zombie survival series, this one improves upon the original with additions such as automated turrets, a weapon that actually has to reload, and zombies that can't walk right through each other. 
This is one of the more polished games I made at that point in my learning. Both internally and externally it was full of firsts: it was the first time that I had attempted to use inheritance to make my code easily extendable; it was also one of the first times I had put extra effort in making the user interface intuitive, visible mostly in the player's aiming reticule that changes size to indicate their accuracy at range, and the reloading dial that fits into the reticule. It was also part of my early experiments in reusable code, featuring a high score system that I used in several games.
Overall, I think this is one of my better pieces of work from when I made it, although I've definitely improved a lot since then!
